# jake101-pinboard-api-vercel
**Microservice for searchable Pinboard links, hosted on Vercel's serverless platform**

This small repo uses [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with the [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) API. It takes advantage of Vercel's easy to use CDN capabilities to be able to use JSON Server in production. Use the JSON Server docs to learn how to query the API and make sure to fill in the .env file with your Pinboard API Key.
